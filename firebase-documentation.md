1. Go to google drive, and get the file named serviceKeyAccount.json
2. Add this to your "the-move" folder
3. Double check that in VSCode it appears right below server.js
4. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed, then install the required packages in the server directory:
**npm install express socket.io firebase-admin**
5. Run npx expo start in VSCode
6. Run node server.js in terminal when you're in the project directory
